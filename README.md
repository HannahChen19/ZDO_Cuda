# ZDO_Cuda
CSC612M Final Project - Parallelization of the ZDO algorithm

**a.) Discussion of parallel algorithms implemented in your program**
The program implements a parallel algorithm for the ZDO algorithm using CUDA. The specific function that is parallelized is the is_zero_indegree function. The parallel algorithms implemented are the: Grid-strid loop, Memory Prefetching, Memory Advise, CUDA Memory Management, Shared Memory, Parallel Reduction, and Cooperative Group.

  a.1) Grid-stride loop

  Grid-stride loop is 

**b.) Execution time comparison between sequential and parallel**


**c.) Detailed analysis and discussion of results**
